libvalacore is an ambitious effort to build a powerful quasi-standard library
for the Vala language.

Vala has a solid GLib/GObject foundation, but lacks the kind of rich,
batteries-included standard library that developers in Java, Go, Python,
or OCaml take for granted. libvalacore fills that gap: it provides intuitive,
consistent, and well-tested APIs for file I/O, collections, string processing,
encoding, cryptography, networking, concurrency, and much more — all designed
to feel natural in idiomatic Vala.

Our goal is to make Vala a language where everyday programming tasks can be
accomplished with a single import, without hunting for scattered third-party
packages or reinventing the wheel.
